# FighterTest

**Part of an Explortation for ShieldsUp!**

**A super accessible Bridge-Sim for the Web**

Built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), a web framework for building virtual reality experiences.

Started building from https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/immersive-aframe-low-poly/.

This is mostly a toy for testing various functionality.
