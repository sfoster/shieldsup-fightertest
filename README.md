# FighterTest

**Part of an Explortation for ShieldsUp!**

**A super accessible Bridge-Sim for the Web**

Built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), a web framework for building virtual reality experiences.

Started building from https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/immersive-aframe-low-poly/ and then wanted to try loading objects
from a database rather than randomly scattering objects.

I started copying a bunch of stuff from https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sqlite3-db to try and get that functionality.

This is mostly a toy for testing various functionality.
